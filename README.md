üéì Art Management System: Master-Details CRUD with Code First ()
This repository contains the source code for a complete Art Management System built with ASP.NET MVC 5. It leverages a Master-Details architecture and the Entity Framework Code First approach to manage database operations, providing robust CRUD functionality.

Comprehensive CRUD for Sales & Details: Full functionality to Create, Read, Update, and Delete both master sales records and their associated detailed artwork items (e.g., specific art pieces sold, quantities).

Master-Details Data Management: A well-structured framework for managing master sale records alongside their subordinate detailed records (e.g., what art was sold, in what quantities) seamlessly.

Code First Database Design: The database schema is designed directly through C# model classes, enabling automatic database creation and migrations for easy setup and updates.

Image Upload Capability: Provides features to upload and display images relevant to each sales record.

Responsive User Interface: Built with Bootstrap 4, ensuring the application looks great and functions well across various screen sizes and devices.

Bash

git clone https://github.com/mdshohagkhan/Mvc-ArtManagement-Master-Details-Code-First-CRUD.git
cd Mvc-ArtManagement-Master-Details-Code-First-CRUD
Running the Project
Open the Solution in Visual Studio:
Double-click the ArtManagementmvc.sln file to open the project solution in Visual Studio.

Restore NuGet Packages:
Right-click on the solution in the Solution Explorer and select Restore NuGet Packages. This will download all the necessary libraries for the project.

Apply Database Migrations:

Open the Package Manager Console (PMC) in Visual Studio: Go to Tools > NuGet Package Manager > Package Manager Console.

Ensure that the ArtManagementmvc project is selected in the Default project dropdown at the top right of the PMC window.

If migrations haven't been set up for this project before, run the following command:

PowerShell

Enable-Migrations
Next, run the command below to create the database or apply any pending changes to an existing one:

PowerShell

Update-Database
This will create your database and its required tables in your SQL Server instance.

Update Connection String:

Open the Web.config file within the ArtManagementmvc project.

Locate the <connectionStrings> section and update the connectionString named AppDbContext to point to your SQL Server instance.

For example:

XML

<add name="AppDbContext" connectionString="Data Source=YOUR_SERVER_NAME;Initial Catalog=ArtManagementDb;Integrated Security=True" providerName="System.Data.SqlClient" />
(Replace YOUR_SERVER_NAME with your actual SQL Server instance name, e.g., (localdb)\MSSQLLocalDB, ., or YOUR_PC_NAME\SQLEXPRESS).

Build the Solution:
Go to the Build menu and select Build Solution, or simply press Ctrl + Shift + B.

Run the Application:
Press F5 in Visual Studio or click the IIS Express button. This will launch the application in your default web browser.
